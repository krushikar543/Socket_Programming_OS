How to run the code:
1) first, run create_admin.c. This will create an admin with username,admin1 and password,passwd;
2) Then run server.c and then client.c in another terminal.

While logging in:
first login as admin, with the credentials mentioned above.
Then admin will have the rights to create single_user_accounts and joint_user_accounts(2 users), where we create users.
NOTE : You can not login as single_user or joint_user without logging in as admin because no user exits initially.
